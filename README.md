MedBase: Pharmacy Inventory and Sales Optimization System is a database-driven application designed to 
enhance the efficiency of pharmacy management. The system aims to replace traditional manual processes 
with a structured, automated solution for managing medicines and tracking sales. MedBase organizes 
pharmaceutical stock into a relational database using SQL, allowing for systematic storage, easy access, 
and real-time updates. It features functionalities such as stock monitoring, low-inventory alerts, expiry date 
notifications, and detailed sales recording. The database includes interlinked tables like Medicines, Sales, 
Suppliers, and Customers to ensure data consistency and integrity. MedBase also enables the generation of 
analytical reports for better decision-making and operational transparency. With a user-friendly interface 
and scalable architecture, the system can be adapted to both small-scale and large-scale pharmacy setups. 
This project not only improves inventory control and billing accuracy but also supports the digital 
transformation of pharmaceutical business operations.
